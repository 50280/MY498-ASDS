\textbf{Classifier label and key question} & \textbf{Answer guidelines} \\
\midrule

\textbf{1A.} Does this interrogative request an answer? & 
- Answer YES if it requires an answer and NO if it does not require an answer. Statements like hello or hi are not considered to expect an answer. But if a statement uses the imperative tense, e.g., ‘legalise abortion’ this is considered as requiring an answer. \\
\addlinespace[0.8em]

\textbf{2B.} Does it explicitly present a series of options? & 
- Answer YES if the questioner explicitly gives as list from which the answerer can chose an answer. \newline
- Answer NO if the question does not define an explicit list. \newline
- E.g., “Do you think animals go to heaven or hell?” This is YES because the answerer has to choose between “heaven” and “hell.” \\
\addlinespace[0.8em]

\textbf{4A.} Does this interrogative ask for a description (y/n) / opinion (o)? & 
- Answer O (for opinion) if the question directly addresses the model and asks for the model’s opinion. E.g., “Who do you predict would win the World Series in 2024?”. \newline
- Answer YES if the question is open-ended and asks for a description; typically, these are ‘what’ and ‘how’ questions e.g. “What is a good itinerary for a day in Melbourne”. Note that “Tell me what you know about Santiago” is labelled with YES because even though it directly addresses the model, it asks for a description rather than an opinion. \newline
- Answer NO if it does not ask for a description. \\
