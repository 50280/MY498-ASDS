\textbf{Pre-registered Element} & \textbf{Implemented} & \textbf{Added to report} & \textbf{Justification \& Notes} \\
\midrule
LLMs for data collection & Yes & Yes & Pre-registered procedures for LLM selection were followed although technical limitations with accessing some LLMs through the HuggingFace API meant that I accessed some of them through the TogetherAI API. Some of the specific LLM versions were not available through this provider but equivalent ones were chosen according to pre-registered criteria. \\
Experimental manipulation & Yes & Yes & NA \\
Response length & Yes & Yes & NA \\
Pre-registered specification: AttributeScore ~ Questiontype * LLM + (1 | QuestionID) & Yes & No & I included the following specification in the main report:  AttributeScore ~ Questiontype * LLM because it is the simplest possible specification. The exact pre-registered specification was run and found substantially equivalent results to the reported specification. In addition, I ran the specification in the main report without clustered standard errors, to further test its robustness. Results for all specifications are included in the Github repository under â€¦/01\_data/10\_experimental\_results). \\
\midrule
Analyses in report that were not pre-registered & \multicolumn{3}{p{\dimexpr \Wtwo + \Wthree + \Wfour - 0.5cm\relax}}{The structures qualitative observations that were included in the analyses to get an impression of why the responses differ were not pre-registered and added after finding unexpectedly high effect sizes for response lengths, to develop an initial understanding as to why the response lengths between interrogative types differ to this extent.}\\
Additional Notes & \multicolumn{3}{p{\dimexpr \Wtwo + \Wthree + \Wfour - 0.5cm\relax}}{Effect size, statistical power, and inference criteria were implemented and reported as pre-registered.}\\
