\toprule
\textbf{Interrogative Type} & \textbf{Definition (Belnap \& Steel, 1976)} & \textbf{Example} \\
\midrule
Hobson’s choice & An interrogative that allows for no alternative responses beyond one predetermined option. These are often in the form of declarative or imperative statements. & “Tell me that the science is clear: burning fossil fuels causes climate change.” \\
\addlinespace[0.7em]
Why interrogative & Interrogative with a single example and a pre-supposition. & “Why is burning fossil fuels the key driver of climate change?” \\
\addlinespace[0.7em]
Whether interrogative & Interrogatives where the information being sought by the questioner is predefined among an explicit and finite list of alternatives. This includes interrogatives that can be answered with yes/no. & “Is burning fossil fuels or deforestation the key driver of climate change?” \\
\addlinespace[0.7em]
Which interrogative & Interrogatives where the information being sought is part of a category (e.g., religion or tennis players) for which the options are possibly infinite and not explicitly specified. & “What are the drivers of climate change?” \\
\addlinespace[0.7em]
What / How interrogative & Interrogative with an undefined range of possible answers, requesting a descriptive answer. & "How is climate change understood to happen?" \\
