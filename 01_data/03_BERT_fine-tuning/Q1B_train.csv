ut31388,"Over Thanksgiving dinner, my father-in-law described his understanding of abortion as the murder of a human child. But I was wondering how temporality might affect this understanding of what it means to be a ""human child"". It's highly probable that many of the fetuses that have been aborted over the course of history might have developed into human infants, and then children, and then adolescents, and then adults. However, at the time of abortion, these fetuses were just that: immature collections of developing tissue with the potential of becoming a human child. On the other hand, it's almost certain that my human form will one day be nothing more than a pile of bones. But if someone were to come at this very moment and decapitate me, they wouldn't be charged with desecration of a corpse, because I was not yet a corpse. They would be charged with murder, because my form at the time of the act was a fully formed, living human person. Does this make sense?",M
